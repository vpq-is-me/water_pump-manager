            The Boost C++ Libraries were successfully built!
            The following directory should be added to compiler include paths:
                /media/vladimir/Work/Distributives/CodeBlocks/libraries/boost_1_78_0
            The following directory should be added to linker library paths:
                /media/vladimir/Work/Distributives/CodeBlocks/libraries/boost_1_78_0/stage/lib

or to somwhere were I copy folder (in my case /usr/include/boost_1_78_0)
{
and add: -lboost_json 
to
Project building options -> linker settings -> Other linker options

or (it is the same result because  "lib" in libboost became "l" in lboost
add path /usr/include/boost_1_78_0/stage/lib/libboost_json.a 
to Project building options -> linker settings -> link libraries
}

if during execution there is error:
./WaterPumpManager: error while loading shared libraries: libboost_json.so.1.78.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


do:
sudo ldconfig /usr/include/boost_1_78_0/stage/lib
(with path to *.so*)


**********************************8
for using jansson.h not forget install jansson library. 
e.i. Dowload jansson progect, and install. For futher info read README in janson library. 
And not forget add -ljansson flag in project build properties in linker other libraries
